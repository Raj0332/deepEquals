Question 5:
Implement the function deepEquals which takes two arguments of any type, and
returns true if they’re identical. For primitives it’s straightforward, for objects (arrays
are also object), it requires a bit more.
The types we want to handle are: 
#all primitives: String, Number, Boolean, Symbol, undefined
#Objects (including Arrays!)
